Silent Hill 2 HD Collection Voice Pack Version 5.0.2 Lite Edition
=================================================================

The Audio Enhancement Pack and FMV Enhancement Pack are NOT Required for this mod to function as they are already used as a base. This is the Lite Edition of the mod, which features compressed audio and CG cutscenes to bring the file size down for those with slow internet. The installer assets are also compressed in order to reduce the file size further. 


=================================

This mod is a passion project which replaces the Original Voice Acting For All Events and in game voices in the game with the HD 2012 voices recorded at PCB Studios in L.A famous for dubbing your favorite games like Persona. It also includes redone FMV's with the HD voices using the FMV Enhancement Pack As A Base. The Enhanced Audio is also used as a base. The HD voices have been remixed to true 2 channel stereo Instead of 5:1 and all mixing errors have been fixed.
