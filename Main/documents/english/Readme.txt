Main Files: This component includes the Enhanced Edition FMV,s, Sound Effects and the required Dialogue files. This is required for the mod to work and cannot be unchecked

Cutscene Subtitle Fixes For All Languages: There are two in-game cutscenes which had their context changed massively in the HD Collection due to oversights. This option fixes the subtitles to accommodate for this. By default this is fixed when playing the game in English only. This options enables this fix for all languages. It is not recommended to enable this fix if you're using translation packs as the files will be overwritten.

Audio Enhancement Pack Music: This option reinstalls the Enhanced Edition music files included in the Audio Enhancement Pack, If you're running the game from a Harddrive or SD card it is highly recomended to enable this options as the game will run into performance issues.

This mod is a passion project which replaces the Original Voice Acting For All Events and in game voices in the game with the HD 2012 voices recorded at PCB Studios in L.A famous for dubbing your favorite games like Persona. It also includes redone FMV's with the HD voices using the FMV Enhancement Pack As A Base. The Enhanced Audio is also used as a base. The HD voices have been remixed to true 2 channel stereo Instead of 5:1 and all mixing errors have been fixed.
